(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune)             Single-night rentals would be banned in Chicago through Airbnb and other online platforms in an effort backed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to crack down on “party houses” as part of a series of stricter rules governing how the vacation rental businesses can operate in the city.     City officials also would have an easier time cracking down on problem renters under the ordinance that passed the City Council License Committee on Tuesday.

Lincoln Park Ald. Michele Smith, 43rd, has been railing for years against the city’s inability to bring rental operators to heel. Smith said she would have preferred to restrict the rentals only to people’s primary residences, since operators who invest in many units for Airbnb where they don’t live have less investment in the neighborhood.

She applauded changes to allow the city to revoke an operator’s vacation rental license for two “pretty serious crimes,” instead of the current three.               “And the scope of the kind of problems have been expanded to include the kind of stuff that we regard as nuisances: noises, smells, loud music. The kind of things we use to regulate bars and restaurants all the time are really now being captured into this business that isn’t really regulated as a business,” Smith said.     The vacation rental rules have been , since Mayor Rahm Emanuel shepherded through regulations on the burgeoning industry.          Single-night rentals are currently banned in Chicago because of the coronavirus pandemic, after Lightfoot complained about young people not social distancing at big house parties. This ordinance would make that prohibition permanent, though the commissioner of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and the police superintendent could decide to allow them to resume without needing City Council approval.

Airbnb policy adviser Rachel DeLevie-Orey testified at the beginning of Tuesday’s meeting, saying the company is cracking down on parties itself, by setting age limits for renters. And during the pandemic, the company is limiting the number of people allowed in each unit.          DeLevie-Orey opposed the permanent single-night booking ban in Chicago, saying doing so is “without merit” because a very low percentage of such bookings result in problems.
