The match was supposed to be March 21. The opponent was supposed to be Atlanta United.

The result, however, was just what they hoped for, with the Fire winning their homecoming match 3-0. Fabian Herbers, Alvaro Medran and Ignacio Aliseda scored for the Fire (2-4-1, 7 points), who picked up their second victory of the on-again, off-again Major League Soccer season.                Advertisement         Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the stands were empty except for tifo, the fan-made banners that adorn soccer stadiums around the world.                     And because there were no fans, the team pumped in crowd noise with Fire-centric chants at multiple levels: at field level, so the players could “feel” the sound; over the Soldier Field sound system to fill the void left by an empty 61,500-seat stadium; and on the WGN-9 and ESPN Plus simulcast.               Even the Fire’s opening goal — scored by Herbers just two minutes into the game — didn’t get the celebration it deserved because of an incorrect offside call that was overturned by the video assistant referee.     Herbers latched on to a diagonal ball from Gaston Gimenez, finishing it first-time, and couldn’t celebrate until the referee viewed a replay of the goal.                Medran’s goal in the 10th minute was a no-doubter: The Spaniard struck a low shot into the bottom corner of the goal from 30 yards out for his first of the season.           The Fire took a 2-0 lead into halftime, thoroughly outplaying Cincinnati (2-4-1, 7 points).

Despite the odd moments and lack of fans, the Fire tried to make the occasion as special as possible.          A red carpet was rolled out for players, and family members submitted videos that played over the large video boards at both ends of the stadium.     No, it wasn’t quite what it was supposed to be. But for the first time in a very long time, the Fire could once again call Soldier Field home.
